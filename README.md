# 🌟 ADHD Planner — Energy‑Based Task Support  
A personal project built to help people (including me) actually get things done when life feels loud, chaotic, or impossible.

## ✨ Why I Built This  
I built this planner because I’ve genuinely struggled with university work, burnout, and that awful “stuck but overwhelmed” feeling.  
I’ve tried every method, every app, every aesthetic notion page — none of it spoke to how my brain actually works.

Then I found *The Anti‑Planner* by Dani Donovan.  
Her work hit me deeply. It teaches you how to understand yourself when you’re stuck, scattered, or drowning in emotions you can’t quite explain. Her book aligns so well with ADHD thinking patterns and the emotional blocks people face when they have too much happening at once.

This project is inspired by that philosophy — but rebuilt as a digital, interactive, energy‑based tool I can actually use daily for uni and life.

## 🎯 What This App Does  
This ADHD planner focuses on *how you’re feeling*, not on rigid productivity.

You choose your energy/emotional state:
- **Stuck**  
- **Overwhelmed**  
- **Unmotivated**  
- **Disorganised**  
- **Discouraged**

Each state opens up small, helpful mini‑tools designed around that specific mental state.

### 🧱 Example Mini‑Tool: Break It Down  
Turn a huge terrifying task into tiny, doable steps.  
Set priorities. Track progress. Be gentle with yourself.

More mini‑tools will be added as the project grows.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
This project is built with:

- **Next.js 14**  
- **TypeScript**  
- **React (Client Components)**  
- **Tailwind CSS**  
- **Cursor AI‑assisted development**  

## 🚀 Running the App Locally  
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## 📌 Project Vision  
The goal is to expand this into a full digital tool inspired by the Anti‑Planner’s emotional and energy‑based strategies — something supportive, realistic, and actually neurodivergent‑friendly.

This planner should *meet you where you are*, not punish you for where you’re not.

## 🤍 Credits  
Huge inspiration from **Dani Donovan** and *The Anti‑Planner: How to Get Sh*t Done When You Don’t Feel Like It*.

This project is built by **Nagwa Houmid El Amrani**, a CS student trying to get her life together one tiny step at a time.
